## Purpose

WaterAPProval is a mobile application that provides reliable and freely available information on physicochemical characteristics and the Marine and Estuarine Water Quality Index for Fauna and Flora Preservation (ICAMpff, by its initials in Spanish) of the water bodies of the city of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.  The data to be processed is obtained from API provided by AquApp which the water quality monitoring program of the bayous and lagoons system of the city that started in 2015.

The application plays an unquestionable role at determining the chemical properties of flora and fauna that may or may not favor the survival of permanent and temporary species in the region. Plus, its ecosystemic services may be also compromised. At the same time, it plays a fundamental involvement from an industrial point of view, as it becomes one of the main requirements for an optimal functioning of all industrial activities that affect public health, this is, the proximity to a water body that supplies clean and safe drinking water continuously.
